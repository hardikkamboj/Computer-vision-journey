# Deep residual learning for image recognition

The introduction has an interesting question - **Is learning better networks as easy as stacking more layers?** The answer seems to by a "yes". If we have a model, and it's giving a good result. It's expected that when we increase the layers, the performance will become better. So, if we train a 20 layer model, and a 56 layer model (VGG type model), it is expected that the 56 layer model will perform better. But, the experiments suggest otherwise -
